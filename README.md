### Hi, I'm Diana Lease! 👋 

💻&nbsp;&nbsp;I write code (and more!) at [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/).

👩🏼‍⚖️&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit PRs, review PRs, and engage the open source community at the [Accord Project](https://github.com/accordproject). I am an elected member of the Technical Steering Committee which meets monthly and Chair of the Technology Working Group which meets weekly.
