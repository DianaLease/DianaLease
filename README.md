### Hi, I'm Diana Lease! 👋 

💻&nbsp;&nbsp;I write code (and more!) at [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer.

👩🏼‍⚖️&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years, I've been actively involved in open source software at the [Accord Project](https://accordproject.org/) as both a contributor and maintainer. I am an elected member of the Technical Steering Committee which meets monthly and Chair of the Technology Working Group which meets weekly.
